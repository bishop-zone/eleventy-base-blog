I've been thinking about the Tremors movies lately, so I sat down and watched the first two. The orginal really holds up and I'm surprised that the second one isn't too bad either. There is something about the campiness that really speaks to me. I think it's that all the characters think (logically for the most part). 

While the first is a near perfect film, the first of it's many sequels has some bits that are lack-luster, but looking past that you find a pretty decent story with more great characters. 

I may revist this to add more thoughts, I wrote some down in a notebook and might try transposing them here.
